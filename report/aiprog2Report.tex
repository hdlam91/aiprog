\section{Third Puzzle}
Our third puzzle is Sudoku, we however have modified the rules a bit because it makes it easier to implement and we feel that this modification makes it more fit to the problem given.\\
The difference between this and the normal Sudoku is the fact that the normal sudoku is usually a 3x3 numbered type of grid (numbers ranging from and including 1 to and including 9), and the board is pre-filled with some numbers inside already, these numbers are not allowed to change whatsoever.\\
Our modified version starts out with an empty board, follows the same rules as the normal Sudoku but we just fill the board in an arbitrary pattern and try to find a solution that doesn't violate the constraints. We do this by randomly filling each "square" with numbers from 1 to k*k (for instance 1-9 for k=3 - which is the normal sudoku sized found in newspapers). We then only swap numbers inside each "square", this is our added constraint. This modified version makes it easy to create hard problems, as we can simply increase $k$ and make bigger boards, thus making it much more complex.

\section{Demonstration of K-queen}
Will be shown on Friday 25. October 2013.
The assignment text  k = 8 is easy, k = 25 is medium and k=1000 is hard-case, but the k = 2500 has a runtime of approximately 1 min.

\section{Demonstration of Graph-color}
Will be shown on Friday 25. October 2013.
We have decided that number 1 is easy, 2 is medium and 3 is hard-case.  These numbers correspond to the txt file given inside the project - that is 1 corresponds to \textit{graph-color-1.txt} etc.\\
The first "easy" one have a 40 nodes/countries and 67 edges/countries bordering each other, the second medium one have 40 nodes and 97 edges while the hardest problem have 500 nodes with 1009 edges.\\
There's included a \textit{graph-color-0.txt} which is the example text provided that told us how to interpret the data, it's not used for the problem; only for debugging and testing, the same goes for \textit{graph-color-test1.txt} file.\\ 
We decided to classify these problems as such because it is more logical that the more edges and nodes you have, the harder the problem becomes. It's also the only input we have for this problem.
This problem is also known as vertex-coloring, which is a problem where you have to color every node with a color so that none of its neighbor have the same color.\\
The data we got is explained here:\href{http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/it3105/materials/data/graph-color-format.txt}{http://www.idi.ntnu.no/emner/it3105/materials/data/graph-color-format.txt},
as you can see, these nodes are provided with coordinates. This coordinates are mostly there for the visual representation if needed, it's not needed for the actual problem, this is because there's no need for information \textbf{where} the nodes are located as long as we know how the edges are connected - and thereby

\section{Demonstration of the modified Sudoku}
Will be shown on Friday 25. October 2013.
%Insert whatever k is for hard, medium and easy <We have decided that k = 2 is easy case, 3 is medium, 4 is hard.>
We have decided to use these \textit{k}s because of the runtime, the k for the hard problem runs in X minutes - which is what the assignment text wants the runtime of a hard problem to be.
