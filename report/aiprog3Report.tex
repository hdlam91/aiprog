\section{PSO problem Task 1}
For this assignment we decided to use 100 particles, it doesn't really matter how many particle we use as long as we have more than a certain number (10 or more should do it).
Every particle updates their velocity vector based on this formula:
\begin{center}
$\vec{v}(t+1)=\vec{v}(t)+(c_1*r_1*(\vec{p}(t)-\vec{x}(t))) +(c_2*r_2*(\vec{g}(t)-\vec{x}(t)))$
\end{center}
Where $x$ is the current position of the particle, $p$ is the local best seen position and $g$ is the global best position seen by the social topology (either every particle or k-nearest neighbor's best position).\\
$r_1$ and $r_2$ are random values in the range $[0,1)$ while $c_1$ and $c_2$ are weights for global/social and local attraction in the range $[0,2)$.\\
The position is the updated by using $\vec{x}(t+1)=\vec{x}(t)+\vec{v}(t+1)$
All the runs we do in Task 1 (b and c) are done with full social topology.
$c_1$ and $c_2$ are set to both be 0.5. These numbers do not seem to have any impact on the runs, however we decided to use 0.5 because that's what the "studass" suggested when we had problems with our code.

\subsection{Task a}
See the code provided (run circle.java file - new Circle(dimensions, lowerCap, upperCap, neighbour, inertia) are the parameters needed) and refer to the demonstration.

\subsection{Task b}

The global fitness is calculated by using the formula $f(\vec{(g)})=g^2$ where $g$ is the global best position seen by the topology. This means that if there's one single particle that have a position that yields a fitness less than 0.001 the code will terminate because this is considered a goal state.
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{tabular}
\caption{10 runs of the 1D circle problem}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
1 iteration in this case means that the particle have already been initialized and then been "updated" once.

\subsection{Task c}
The run of the 2D circle problem. We decided to use 10 runs on this assignment too because we felt that 1 run only wasn't providing sufficient data.
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l| l  c}
Run \# & Global fitness& Iterations\\ \hline
1&$3.8168253161518443*10^{-4}$ & 175\\ 
2&$4.243457509488848*10^{-4}$ & 203\\

4&$7.435433559028153*10^{-4}$ & 30\\
5&$2.3583403176644232*10^{-5}$ & 111\\ 
6&$5.247282371692319*10^{-4}$ & 16\\ 
7&$1.1476111187016657*10^{-4}$ & 4\\ 
8&$3.595110993895342*10^{-4}$ & 139\\
9&$1.8857838445339898*10^{-4}$ & 16\\ 
10&$2.1871500510193647*10^{-4}$ & 126\\ 
\end{tabular}
\caption{10 runs of the 2D circle problem}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
As we can see in this table; it takes more iterations to find the rooster/goal for the particles than in the 1D circle problem due to the extra dimension added.

\section{Task 2}
This task uses k-nearest neighbor topology. The particles will only update the $\vec{g}$ based on its 3 nearest neighbor's $\vec{g}$. 
\subsection{Task a}
1D and 2D run of 3 nearest neighbor without decreasing inertia weight.

\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}
\subsection{Task b}
1D and 2D run of 3 nearest neighbor with decreasing inertia weight.
$\vec{v}(t+1)=(w*\vec{v}(t))+(c_1*r_1*(\vec{p}(t)-\vec{x}(t))) +(c_2*r_2*(\vec{g}(t)-\vec{x}(t)))$

\end{center}

\end{figure}
\section{Task 3}\label{3}
For this task we decided to use the binary knapsack solution as suggested by the lecturer. Every particle have n dimensions (where n is number of packages) and for every dimension there's either a position 0 or 1 that shows if the package is included or not.
In other (more precise words):
For every particle there's n number of dimensions, $x_j$ can either be 0 or 1.
If $x_j = 1$ then package number $j$ is included in the container, if $x_k = 0$ then package number $k$ is not included in the container.

\subsection{Task a}
See the code provided (run Knapsack\_problem.java - new Knapsack\_problem(dimensions, numParticles, lowerCap, upperCap, inertia, maxIter, volume) are the parameters needed) and refer to the demonstration.

\subsection{Task b}

\end{figure}

\section{Task 4}
The Knapsack PSO problem from Task \ref{3} is extended with random volume values for each package. These values range from $1m^3$ to $5m^3$, however due to a notice on It's learning we decreased the max volume from $1000m^3$ to $250m^3$.
